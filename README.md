I have been tasked with making Horiseon's website more accessible and to clean up their code.

To accomplish this task, I have added a concise and easy to understand title to their website.

In addition, I have added alt tags to all images that appear on the webpage.

In order to clean up Horiseon's code, I have replaced all unnecessary div class tags with appropriate semantic tags in compliance with industry standards. 

In addition, I have consolidated their css code where applicable and left comments detailing my changes in the code. 

Horiseon now has a website which will score higher on SEO/SEM and which will be accessible to a greater number of clients.
